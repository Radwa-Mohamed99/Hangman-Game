Welcome to the Hangman Game! 🎉 This classic word guessing game will challenge your vocabulary and guessing skills. The game has simple rules and provides a fun way to test your word knowledge.




## Game Rules 📝

1. **Objective**: Guess the letters in the hidden word to reveal it. You have a total of 3 chances.
2. **Hints**: Before you start, you will get a hint about the word.
3. **Guesses**: You can guess one letter at a time.
4. **Winning**: If you reveal the whole word before running out of chances, you win!
5. **Losing**: If you run out of chances before guessing the word, you lose.

## How to Play 🕹️

1. **Start the Game**: Upon starting the game, a hint will be provided.
2. **Guess a Letter**: Enter a letter you think might be in the word.
3. **Check Your Guess**: If your guess is correct, the letter will appear in its correct position(s) in the word.
4. **Hangman Drawing**: After each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. You have 3 incorrect guesses before the game ends. You can see an example of the hangman drawing process in the video below.
5. **Win or Lose**: Guess all the letters correctly to win, or run out of guesses to lose.
